Great! Setting up **Redis Sentinel** with **Memurai** on Windows can help you monitor high availability and automatic failover for Redis instances.

The official guide you shared is helpful, but let me walk you through a **clear step-by-step version**, based on that article and adding some practical CMD usage for Windows.

---

## 🧭 Goal:
Run:
- One **primary Memurai server**
- One or more **Sentinel processes** monitoring that primary

> **Note:** Memurai CE only allows one instance. For more advanced use (e.g., multiple Redis instances on the same machine), you’ll need **Memurai for Developers** or use multiple machines.

## ✅ Step-by-Step Guide: Set Up Redis Sentinel on Windows with Memurai

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Install Memurai

If you haven’t already:

1. Download Memurai: [https://www.memurai.com/download](https://www.memurai.com/download)
2. Install it and make sure it's running.

Test with:
```cmd
redis-cli.exe ping
```
✅ You should get:
```
PONG
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Configure Memurai as a Redis Server

Open the config file (usually found at):
```
C:\Program Files\Memurai\memurai.conf
```

Make sure the following lines are set:

```conf
port 6379
bind 0.0.0.0
protected-mode no
```

If you use a password:

```conf
requirepass YourSecurePassword
```

🔄 Then restart Memurai:
```cmd
net stop memurai
net start memurai
```

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Create Sentinel Config File

Create a new file, for example:
```
C:\Memurai\sentinel.conf
```

Paste this inside:

```conf
port 26379
sentinel monitor mymaster 127.0.0.1 6379 1
sentinel down-after-milliseconds mymaster 5000
sentinel failover-timeout mymaster 10000
sentinel parallel-syncs mymaster 1
```

> 🔐 If you use a password in Memurai, also add:
```conf
sentinel auth-pass mymaster YourSecurePassword
```

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Run Sentinel from CMD

Go to your Memurai folder (where `memurai.exe` is located), and run:

```cmd
cd "C:\Program Files\Memurai\bin"
memurai.exe sentinel C:\Memurai\sentinel.conf
```

✅ You should see output showing Sentinel is running and monitoring the master.

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Check if Sentinel is working

Open another CMD window and try:

```cmd
redis-cli.exe -p 26379
```

Then inside the Redis CLI, run:

```redis
SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster
```

It should return:

```
1) "127.0.0.1"
2) "6379"
```

This means Sentinel knows the master.

---

## 🧪 Optional: Test Failover (Advanced)

If you want to test failover:

1. Stop the Memurai server:
   ```cmd
   net stop memurai
   ```

2. Watch Sentinel output — it will mark the master as down.

## 🧾 Summary of Files:

| Component       | File Path                            |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| Memurai Config | `C:\Program Files\Memurai\memurai.conf` |
| Sentinel Config| `C:\Memurai\sentinel.conf`            |

---

Let me know if you want to run multiple Redis/Memurai nodes on the same machine (using different ports), or simulate failover more realistically!
